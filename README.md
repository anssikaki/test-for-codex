# Test for Codex

This repository contains small examples used for the Codex agent.

## Visual Storyteller Demo

This repository now includes a small demo that showcases how to embed a
custom HTML component inside Streamlit. The component displays a title and
reveals each sentence of a story with a typewriter effect on a dark
starfield background.

### Running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run test-for-codex.py
```
